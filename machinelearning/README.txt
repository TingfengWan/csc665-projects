Assignment 5 - Machine Learning

Perceptron: Written based on scaffolding from question prompt (nn.DotProduct for run(),
    evaluating dot product as scalar for prediction, and self-adjust until fit)
    *used learning_rate with nontrivial value, then realized rate need not be set
Non-Linear Regression: 2-Layer NN with 128 hidden units with ReLU initial activation 
    function, trained using gradient-based updates
Digit Classification: used the literal same NN as Part II
    >it just w o r k s
Language Identification:  2-layer RNN with 256 hidden units using ReLU for initial and
    hidden layer activation function
    *initially used 0.81 as threshold for fitness, but such networks are undertrained for
        test inputs

Time Spent: ~15 Hours (training takes a long time man)
